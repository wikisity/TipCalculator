## Notes

Switching between layouts can be difficult. I first had a clear idea
of how I wanted to have each object display on the screen or home page of the App.
Then I wanted to move some object around or change the position of the title.
It was a little challenging to have the background color of the title **TipCalculator**
occupied the entire width of the top view. Also I am not sure if it was an OS problem, but 
the keyboard pad did not show at first. After re-running the app a few times, I Was able to
use the keyboard type - decimal pad.
