# Pre-work - *TipCalculator*

**TipCalculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Rabson Arnold**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are to be implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are to be implemented:

- [ ] User would receive random gift card depending on the tip percent chosen!

## Notes

One challenge I had was to make background color 
of the the title **TipCaluclator**
fits into the top view of the App. It was a little challenging 
to re-change the layout to a new one. I am not sure if it was 
an OS issue, but the keyboard type - Decimal pad
did not work at first. I then had to re-run the app a few times to finally 
have a display of the keyboard pad.
